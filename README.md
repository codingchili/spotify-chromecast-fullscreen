# Spotify webplayer fullscreen
Modifies the Spotify web player for an improved chromecast look. :green_heart:

Note: In 2019 there is a chromecast receiver application for Spotify that looks very good and can be used instead. This was probably not the case in 2017. Anyways, if you want to enjoy a cleaner look on a desktop this can be used there as well.

#### Installation

Follow the instructions.

1. Start by browsing to [play.spotify.com](http://play.spotify.com) 
2. Click this link and copy the [script](spotify.webplayer.modify-2019.4.js) in this repository.
3. Now hit hit F12 in the Spotify webplayer and paste the following script into the console.
4. To enter the fullscreen mode click on the Spotify logo.
5. To exit fullscreen mode click on the album art image.

**Note**: please don't willy nilly copy scripts into your console. Scripts can hijack the browser session and steal cookies etc.
