# Spotify webplayer fullscreen
Modifies the Spotify web player for an improved chromecast look. :green_heart:

Note: In 2019 there is a chromecast receiver application for Spotify that looks very good and can be used instead. This was probably not the case in 2017. Anyways, if you want to enjoy a cleaner look on a desktop this can be used there as well.

#### Installation
Install by browsing to [play.spotify.com](http://play.spotify.com) and then you hit F12 and paste the following script into the console [script](https://github.com/codingchili/spotify-chromecast-fullscreen/blob/master/spotify.webplayer.modify-2019.4.js) in this repository.

**Note**: please don't willy nilly copy scripts into your console. Scripts can hijack the browser session and steal cookies etc.

List of supported browsers :grin:

|Browser|
|---|
|Chrome!|

#### Instructions
- To enter chromecast mode press the Spotify logo in the upper left corner.
- To exit chromecast mode press album art.
